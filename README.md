## Text Classification of News Articles using FCD and Naive-Baiyes
This text mining project was inspired by a paper by Meng et al published in 2011 titled "A two-stage feature selection method for text categorization" where a two stage feature selection method is implemented before applying support vector machine to classify text data. This project is my attempt to replicate the imlementation of the first stage of the feature selection technique called FCD (Feature Contribution Degree) which is first proposed in this paper and to see how effective it is as a feature selection in its own. Hence, the second part of the feature selection stage (namely LSI) is not implemented and instead of the use of the SVM classifier, I will try to see how effective this feature selection technique is when applied together with the Multinomial-Naive
